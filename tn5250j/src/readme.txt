tn5250j README
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is an implementation of the 5250 telnet protocol in java.  I started it
because I could not find a 5250 emulator of Linux with the enhanced functions
like graphical windows, cursor progression, continued edit fields, masked edit
fields etc.....

This, the 0.5.x release, is beta but is stable and being used in a development
environment so should not cause to many headaches but may contain bugs :-))

===============================================================================
NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

From version 0.5.4 on I will only be supporting 1.3 versions of the JDK/JRE and
greater.  I can not keep testing on every version of the JDK and think that one
major version back is sufficient.

For all users that already have the emulator installed.  The references to
my5250.jar are changed to reflect tn5250j.jar.  We are starting a new
distribution mechanism and changing a few things around.  We hope that this
does not prove to much of an inconvenience.

The binary file downloads will contain a jar file named tn5250j.jar and this
document reflects these changes by using this name instead of the old my5250.jar

1. Installing
=======================

1)  Place the tn5250j.jar file in a directory that you choose.
2)  For e-mailing screen shots please read the e-mail.txt file included in the
       source file that was downloaded.

2. Quick Start
=======================
2)  java -jar tn5250j.jar

    On first invocation of the emulator there where be some warning messages
    that will be output to the console.  These are to inform you that defaults
    files are being setup for you for first run.

    You will be presented with a Connections screen for defining sessions.
    Select the add button to define sessions when the session selection
    window is displayed.
           or
    java -jar tn5250j.jar host -p port
           or
    java -jar tn5250j.jar host


    2a. Command line options:  (If you do not want to use the configure button)
    -------------------------
    -p port ----> port to be used - default is port 23 if not specified

    -f filename ----> configuration file

    -t ----> use system name instead of system id Host IP Address/DNS Host name.

    -cp ---> Code Page
                Supported code pages
                --------------------
                37 - US default

                870-pl - Poland

                Let me know of others that are needed.  The code pages can be
                updated quickly.

    -e ---->  Enhanced 5250 option.  This gives graphical windows, edit masked
               fields, continued edit fields, etc...
               ** Note ** not all enhanced options are implemented as yet.
               I have only implemented what our applications use here and should
               be considered as improving (buggy :-)).  At our site we have not
               had any problems with it yet (note the word yet please).
               Watch for further announcements and improvements.

    -L ---->   Specify the locale/language to be used for literals.  The default
               is the locale of the system if it is supported.

                  Available Languages
                     Default -> Supported locale of the system or English
                     Spanish -> -L es
                     German -> -L de
                     French  -> -L fr
                     Portuguese -> -L pt
                     Catalan -> -L ca_ES
                     Dutch -> -L nl
                     Italian -> -L it
                     Polish -> -L pl

    -132 ----> Change to 27*132 column.

    -s ------> Start up emulator using an existing configured session
                  you can specify multiple of these as in -s xxxx -s yyyy
                  and at startup the emulator will start up session xxxx and
                  yyyy.  This does not use the sessions file but the entries
                  that are defined inside for PRE-EXISTIING session
                  definitions.

                  format of the session entries:
                  ------------------------------

                  systemName=route-to-host [options as described above]
                  
                  The parameter is used along the systemName entry that
                  is passed on the command line.  Please see examples 
                  below.

               ==========================================================
               **** NOTE **** Session names are case sensitive!!!!!!!
               ==========================================================


    -width --> Start up emulator using the width specified

    -height -> Start up emulator using the height specified

    -d ------> if no other instances are running and the -nc options is not
               specified then start up the bootstrap monitoring thread

    -nc -----> no check for other tn5250j instances that are running
                    A new frame will be created within another instance
                    of JVM

    -noembed-> Do not add a new session tab but open in new frame.  Default
               is embed so add a new session tab in the visible frame.

    -usp ----> Use Socks Proxy
    -sph ----> Socks Proxy Host - please read step 10 below.
               I do believe that you can set the user name and password to be
               used by supplying the following on the the command line to start
               the emulator.
               -Djava.net.socks.username="username" <- replace user name with yours
               -Djava.net.socks.password="password" <- replace password with yours

               Example command line:
               =====================
               java -Djava.net.socks.username="kjp1" -Djava.net.socks.password="tn5250j" -jar tn5250j.jar

               I have not tried this so please let me know if it works.

    -spp ----> Socks Proxy Port

    -dn -----> This option takes a device name parameter to be used
               by the Host.  The device name is 10 characters in
               length and following rfc2877 it the device name
               is already allocated then the device name will be
               sent again with a consecutive number appended.  If
               the device name plus appended sequencial number is
               longer than 10 characters then the device name is
               truncated until the device name and the appended
               sequential number fits within 10 characters.

             For example:
             -dn DEVICEUSER

             This will send the device name on allocation to the host
             as DEVICEUSER.  If there is already a session allocated
             with device name DEVICEUSER then the emulator will send
             the device name with a 1 (number one) appended as
             DEVICEUSE1 if this is allocated then DEVICEUSE2 and so
             on until the host says no more attempts are allowed or
             the same device name is sent twice in succession as per
             rfc2877.

             This option will also change the session name to that
             of the allocated device name.

    -MDI ----> Use the MDI interface represented by JInternalFrames instead of
               tabs.
               --------- N O T E ---------
               New feature for now and is in testing.  Please send comments/
               feedback/bugs.



    2b Example of command line options
    -----------------------------------

    java -jar tn5250j.jar -L es

        This will change the default language of the system to use the languange
        translations of what is specified.

    java -jar tn5250j.jar hostAS400 -f hostAS400.prop

       This will connect to hostAS400 and use the file hostAS400.prop as the
       property file.  Any properties that are changed will be saved to this
       file under the current directory.  It does not have to exist as it will
       be created.  If there are any properties saved from a previous session
       then those will be read and used.  It uses the code page 37 which is
       default.

    java -jar tn5250j.jar parisAS400 -f parisAS400.prop -cp 297

        This will connect to parisAS400 use the property file as described above
        and use the code page 297 for french.

    java -jar tn5250j.jar spainAS400 -f spainAS400.prop -cp 284 -e

        This will connect to spainAS400 use the property file as described above
        and use the code page 284 for spanish and will notify the as400 that it
        can send enhanced commands.

      **** Note the -e can be used on all sessions.


    2c Example of command line option -s
    -------------------------------------

       format of the session entries:
       ------------------------------

       systemName=route-to-host [options as described above]


       Sample sessions file
       --------------------

luxembourg=lux -f luxgui.prop -e -gui
lux-nogui=lux -f lux.prop -e
houilles=houilles -f houilles.prop -cp 297 -e
paris=paris -f paris.prop -cp 297 -e
spain=spain -f spain.prop -cp 284 -e


==========================================================
**** NOTE **** Session names are case sensitive!!!!!!!
==========================================================

    Command line usage follows:

    java -jar tn5250j.jar -s luxembourg

    This will search the session file for the entry luxembourg and if found
    use the the entry parameters that are defined for that session.

    So using the Sample sessions file described above the program would read
    the -s option and obtain luxembourg.  It would then search the sessions
    file for this entry and if found execute the options that where there:
    
    system/ip addrss = lux
    configuration file = luxgui.prop
    -e = use enhanced mode
    -gui = start in gui mode
    
    If an entry is not found for the -s option then the Connection dialog
    is displayed for you to enter a new connection or select a pre existing
    one from the list.

3. Keybindings
==============

These are the default key bindings.  You can remap these by clicking on the
map keys from the popup menu.

Home		      Home position
End		      End of field
Alt + PageUp	Next Session
Alt + PageDn	Previous Session

Alt + O        Debug output mode (see not below)

*** NOTE *** Alt + O (not zero) by itself will turn on debugging mode that I use
for testing and will probably slow down the session painting because it outputs
all input data streams to log.txt and to the screen.  I will take this out as
soon as I can.  If you have any other suggestions or key combinations for this
let me know!!!!!!  Oh by the way this toggles the mode so if it is on then
hitting it one more time will turn it off.

5. Menu Options Descriptions
============================

Copy - Copies bounded area or if no bounded area selected copies the screen to
         the clipboard to be pasted

Paste - Pastes clipboard data to the screen

Paste Special - This will paste the data from the clipboard stripping all non
                  letter and non numeric characters.

   Example:
   --------
                                 Display Report
                                              Report width . . . . . :     556
 Position to line  . . . . .              Shift to column  . . . . . .
 Line   ....+....1....+....2....+....3....+....4....+....5....+....6....+....7..
        Opening Branch......  Company Id..........  Application Code....       A
 000001         1,091                00069                   D
 000002         2,010                00069                   D
 000003         2,010                00069                   D
 000004         2,010                00069                   D
 000005         2,010                00069                   D


   The Opening Branch...... field has a comma within the field, if you do just a
   regular copy and paste into a field you would get 1,091 which sometimes is
   not formatted correctly so you would use the paste special and what would be
   pasted is 1091

Selected columns and Selected rows - shows the status of the selection.  We use
            this to count the characters of a selection.  Note these two entries
            will only show up if there is a bounded area specified.

Sum Area -  This option will only show up if there was a bounded area selected
            for example copy and paste.

            You can select two different formats to parse numbers.  The Grouping
            separator as ',' and a '.' as Decimal Separator, #,###.## or
            the grouping seaparator as '.' and a ',' as Decimal Separator,
            #.###,##  .

Print Screen - Prints the screen

System Request - Issues a System Request to the AS400 system

Help - NOTE this is not application help but the help key that is sent to the
         AS400

Host Print - This will send a host print to the AS400 which will print the
               screen to the users spool

Display Messages - Will only display if there are messages waiting (ie. the
                     MW light is on).  When the option is selected the messages
                     will be displayed.  Alt + M will also do this but you can
                     press this at any time.

Hex Map - Displays a hex map of ASCII characters that can be inserted into the
            current field

Map Keys - Displays a window to allow remapping of the keys for the emulator

Settings - Displays a window to allow the changing of the font, colors,
            cursor size and column separator.

Macros - If there are macros defined then this item will be displayed.  It will
            have a submenu of all macros defined across the sessions.  More
            information can be found in the macros.txt file.

Transfer file - The user is presented with a screen to fill out the file
                  information to be downloaded.  More information can be
                  found in the filetransfers.txt file.

Send Screen - Send screen via e-mail.  More information can be
                  found in the e-mail.txt file.

Connect/Disconnect - This is a toggle switch.  When connected this entry will
            read Disconnect and when disconnected this item will read Connect.

Close this session - Will popup a options panel that will allow you to close
            the current session or all sessions and remove the sessions from
            the session tab panel.

Left mouse button held down allows you to specify a bounding area.


6. Tested Systems/Operating systems

NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

From version 0.5.4 on I will only be supporting 1.3 versions of the JDK/JRE and
greater.  I can not keep testing on every version of the JDK and think that one
major version back is sufficient.

===============================================================================
NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The JDK's tested are from Sun.  If there are any others please let me know.

   You will have to remap the keys to get the keys to work correctly.

!!! Please no operating system or desktop flames please !!!!

MAC OS

It works and I have screen shots now.  Thank you for sending me screen shots.
I still do not have any specifics of the JDK/JVM used.

7. Compiling the source
=======================
   Please read the antbuild.tx file for compiling via Ant

8. Sending screen by e-mail
===========================
   Please read the e-mail.txt file for setting up sending screen via e-mail.

9. Emulator used as an applet
=============================
   Please read the applet.txt file for using the emulator as an applet

10. Proxy Support
=================
SOCKS protocol support settings
The SOCKS username and password are acquired in the following way.
First, if the application has registered a java.net.Authenticator default
instance, then this will be queried with the protocol set to the string
"SOCKS5", and the prompt set to to the string "SOCKS authentication".
If the authenticator does not return a username/password or if no authenticator
is registered then the system checks for the user preferences
"java.net.socks.username" and "java.net.socks.password". If these preferences do
not exist, then the system property "user.name" is checked for a username. In
this case, no password is supplied.

The previous information is taken from the Java Documentation and is copyrighted
by Sun Microsystems.

I think I got this correct.  Please see command line option -sph above for
example use of username and password.  Let me know if this works.

11. Acknowledgements
====================

Special thanks go out to the pre-beta testers that test the constant changes before
anyone else gets to see it.  When they say there are no problems then I release
the code to the others.
