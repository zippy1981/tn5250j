Ant build README
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have only tested this with ant build 1.4.1 so do not know if it is backwards
compatible with previous versions.

Steps to get started after setting up ant
-----------------------------------------
1. Create a base directory to place source
2. Create two directories beneath the base directory called lib and src

for example your directory structure should look like the following:

base directory
   |
   + - lib
   |
   + - src

3. Unzip and place all source files from tn5250j source zip file that was
   downloaded into src directory.  This includes the Meta-inf directory.
4. Place the included build.xml file into the base directory.
5. Place the extra .jar files used for mailing in the lib directory.
   *** NOTE *** this is very important or some modules will not compile

   You can download the e-mail api's from sun.  You will need two packages.
      http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/
      http://java.sun.com/products/javabeans/glasgow/jaf.html

   JavaMail jar files
   ------------------
   activation.jar
   mail.jar
   mailapi.jar
   smtp.jar

6. Now execute ant using one of the methods described in the ant documentation.

   using the sample bat file for windows below:

   c:\basedirectory>build all


   Sample Windows build.bat that I use on windows
   ----------------------------------------------
@echo off

rem this batch-file can be used to override the java_home or ant_home
rem environment or to set a special classpath and so on...
set ANT_HOME=D:\jakarta-ant-1.4.1
set JAVA_HOME=C:\jdk1.3.1

call %ANT_HOME%\bin\ant -buildfile build.xml %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9

   ----------------------------------------------

*** NOTE FOR JAVA 1.4 ***
use the builddep.xml file because there are deprecated API's,


If you have any questions or suggestions please let me know.  If you have code
changes PLEASE PLEASE send them to me.

Enjoy!!!
