      SOCKS protocol support settings</p>
      <p>
      The SOCKS username and password are acquired in the following way.
      First, if the application has registered a <code>java.net.Authenticator</code> default
      instance, then this will be queried with the protocol set to the string
      "SOCKS5", and the prompt set to to the string "SOCKS authentication".
      If the authenticator does not return a username/password or if no authenticator
      is registered then the system checks for the user preferences
      <code>java.net.socks.username</code> and <code>java.net.socks.password</code>.
      If these preferences do
      not exist, then the system property "user.name" is checked for a username. In
      this case, no password is supplied.</p>

      I think I got this correct.  Please see command line option -sph above for
      example use of username and password.  Let me know if this works.</p>
