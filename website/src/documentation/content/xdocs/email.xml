            </li>
          </ul></li>
        <li>Unzip the files into there respective directories.  I use the same directory
        names as provided within the zip files.</li>
    </ol>
  </section>
  <section><title>Deployment</title>
    <p>
    Copy the file activation.jar from the /jaf-1.0.1 file to the SAME DIRECTORY as
    the tn5250j.jar.</p>
    <p>Copy the files</p>
      <ul>
        <li>mail.jar</li>
        <li>mailapi.jar</li>
        <li>smtp.jar</li>
      </ul>
      <p>to the SAME DIRECTORY as the tn5250j.jar.</p>
      <p>
      If you list the directory where the tn5250j.jar file is you should see 4 files
      with the extension .jar.  If this is not true then go to step one of Deployment
