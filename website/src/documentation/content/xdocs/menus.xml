   The Opening Branch...... field has a comma within the field, if you do just a
   regular copy and paste into a field you would get 1,091 which sometimes is
   not formatted correctly so you would use the paste special and what would be
   pasted is 1091</p>
   <p>
Selected columns and Selected rows - shows the status of the selection.  We use
            this to count the characters of a selection.  Note these two entries

<p>
Sum Area1   This option will only show up if there was a bounded area selected
            for example copy and paste.
</p>
<p>
            You can select two different formats to parse numbers.  The Grouping
            separator as ',' and a '.' as Decimal Separator, #,###.## or
            the grouping seaparator as '.' and a ',' as Decimal Separator,
            #.###,##  .
