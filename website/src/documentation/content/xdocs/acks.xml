      Special thanks go out to the pre-beta testers that test the constant changes before
      anyone else gets to see it.  When they say there are no problems then I release
      the code to the others.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Irene Serrano</li>
        <li>Jesus Irausquin</li>
        <li>Didac Lopez</li>
        <li>Ricardo Fermin</li>
        <li>Patrick Bielen</li>
        <li>Christian Geisert</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      Without their constant testing and feedback there would be a lot more bugs.</p>
      <p>
      For changes to the current version/release please see the CHANGELOG.txt file.</p>
