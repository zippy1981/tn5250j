tn5250j CHANGELOG
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO/WISHLIST
-------------

Implement the insert (right shift of characters) for continued edit fields.

Add support for maintaining macros.  Think GUI interface.

Work on RFE defined as bug to support SNGCHCFLD.  The specifications are very
large to implement this - 57 pages worth of specs and the such.  Elementary
support for this is now there.  We no longer have session errors with this.

Implement support for images on the background. Wishlist for the future

Add option for sending partial screen information to file and/or e-mail.

Add restore of session sizes in MDI session interface.

Known problems
--------------
On some JVM linux machines the keymappings will have to be changed from the
default that I set up.  This is for JVM supplied by IBM.
